======================
Make and use Snapshots
======================

You can create Snapshots from your instances to use them as a backup, or if you want to create the same instance again.
Click behind the instance an the arrow and navigate to snapshot:

.. figure:: ../../images/create-snapshot-1.png
    :name: fig-create-snapshot-1
    :align: left
    :width: 100%

Name the snapshot maybe with instancename-date or something like that, so you can find it better in the future.

.. figure:: ../../images/create-snapshot-2.png
    :name: fig-create-snapshot-2
    :align: left
    :width: 100%

The snapshot will be stored in the imagelist under the name you choose before:

.. figure:: ../../images/create-snapshot-3.png
    :name: fig-create-snapshot-3
    :align: left
    :width: 100%

Now you can use the snapshot like images.
